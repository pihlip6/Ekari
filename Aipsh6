That’s why I want to say this now When you’re in Batangas I think it would be best if we stop talking for a while I believe it would be good for both of us especially for you I know so much about you and I love every bit of it You’re not hard to love you just need time to heal and find more peace of mind I’m not saying this because I can’t handle you It’s just that I feel a little drained and tired But please understand I still love you

Maybe I feel this way because I remember my past talking stage When I went back to Iloilo she would always ghost me but I chose to understand her Then one day out of nowhere she wanted to talk only to tell me that we should just be friends I gave my all but in the end she still didn’t choose me She even treated her friends better than she treated me and I just couldn’t understand why I deserved that I don’t want to go through that kind of pain again That’s why I’m telling you this now I don’t want you to question yourself or wonder why I’m saying this later on I just don’t want to experience that same heartbreak again

But if someday our paths cross again and we’ve both become better versions of ourselves I would love to have you back in my life And if while we’re not talking you find someone who treats you better than I ever did I want you to choose what makes you happiest You deserve the best and all I’ve ever wanted is what’s good for you
   \n\nGoodbye,\n[philip]"
